# The largest heading (an <h1> tag)
## The second largest heading (an <h2> tag)
…
###### The 6th largest heading (an <h6> tag)

styling text: bold and italic:
*This text will be italic*
**This text will be bold**

Both bold and italic can use either a * or an _ around the text for styling. This allows you to combine both bold and italic if needed.

**Everyone _must_ attend the meeting at 5 o'clock today.**

unordered list

ordered lists
1. Item 1
2. Item 2
3. Item 3


nested list:
1. Item 1
  1. A corollary to the above item.
  2. Yet another point to consider.
2. Item 2
  * A corollary that does not need to be ordered.
    * This is indented four spaces, because it's two spaces further than the item above.
    * You might want to consider making a new list.
3. Item 3


code formatting:

inline formats:
Use single backticks (`) to format text in a special monospace format. Everything within the backticks appear as-is, with no other special formatting.

multiple lines:
use the (```) to format text as its own distinct block
Check out this neat program I wrote:

```
x = 0
x = 2 + 2
what is x
```

links:


You can create an inline link by wrapping link text in brackets ( [ ] ), and then wrapping the link in parentheses ( ( ) ).

For example, to create a hyperlink to www.github.com, with a link text that says, Visit GitHub!, you'd write this in Markdown: [Visit GitHub!](https://www.github.com).
